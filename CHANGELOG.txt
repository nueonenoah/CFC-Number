# CFC Number CHANGELOG

All notable changes to the CFC Number project will be documented in this file.

## \[2.4\] - 2025-04-18

### Changed

- Reordered social links in the "Get to Know Me Better and Always Support Me" section: GitHub now appears above Telegram.
- Updated the "About Me" label to use bold text with `Arial 10` font for improved visibility.
- Added `@` prefix to GitHub link text (`GitHub: @nueonenoah`) for consistency with Telegram link.
- Updated version number to `v2.4` in the application title and About dialog for consistency.
- Adjusted About dialog to reflect new social link order (GitHub above Telegram).

## \[2.3\] - 2025-04-18

### Changed

- Centered the layout of the "Get to Know Me Better and Always Support Me" section (Features and About Me) horizontally using a `center_frame` with `padx=50`, while keeping text left-aligned.
- Increased padding between Features and About Me sub-frames (`padx=(0, 20)`) for better visual separation.

## \[2.2\] - 2025-04-18

### Changed

- Moved the Features section from the top of the GUI (below Header) to the "6. Get to Know Me Better and Always Support Me" section, displayed side-by-side with About Me.
- Combined Features and About Me under a single heading: "6. Get to Know Me Better and Always Support Me".
- Reduced font size to `Arial 9` for Features and About Me text to fit the side-by-side layout.
- Updated tooltip for the combined section to reflect both features and creator information.

## \[2.1\] - 2025-04-18

### Changed

- Replaced the "6. Preview Output" section with "6. About Me", displaying creator information (Telegram: @nueonenoah, GitHub: nueonenoah) with clickable links and emoji icons (ðŸ“± for Telegram, ðŸ’» for GitHub).
- Removed preview-related code and variables (`preview_text`, `preview_content`) to address privacy concerns.
- Updated About dialog to remove reference to preview feature and include creator contact details.
- Added `webbrowser` module to enable clickable links in the About Me section.

### Fixed

- Corrected a typo in `proses_injeksi` function parameter (`format_pilir` to `format_pilihan`).

## \[2.0\] - 2025-04-18

### Added

- Input validation:
  - Checks if a file is selected before processing.
  - Validates `.txt` file content using regex to ensure only alphanumeric strings, underscores, or hyphens are processed.

- Batch processing support for multiple `.txt` files via `askopenfilenames`.
- Cancel button to interrupt processing with a `cancel_process` flag.
- Open Folder button to directly access the output directory, with cross-platform support (Windows, macOS, Linux).
- Threading for `proses_injeksi` to keep the GUI responsive during processing.

### Changed

- Transitioned from a terminal-based interface to a full GUI using `tkinter` and `ttkthemes` (arc theme).
- Optimized file reading to use streaming (`for line in f`) for better memory efficiency with large files.
- Enhanced GUI layout with numbered sections (1. Choose Icon, 2. Format Links, etc.) and a modern color scheme.
- Updated About dialog to reflect new features and GUI-based workflow.

## \[1.0\] - \[Initial Release\]
